This stack contains various packages provided by the Center for Applied Autonomous 
Sensor Systems (AASS) at Orebro University, Sweden. The packages currently provided are:

pointcloud_vrml/  : a set of utility routines for reading and writing vrml files 
		    to pointclouds

ndt_map/	  : the core of the Normal Distributions Transform packages. Implements
		    several spatial indexing data structures and functions to compute
		    the NDTs of point clouds
		    
ndt_registration/ : package that implements 3D-NDT registration of point sets. Parameters
		    of the matching are currently passed internally, but will be taken out
		    into configuration files. Optimization is performed using a native 
		    Newton's scheme (with More-Thuente line search for step size).
		    Input is passed as point cloud files, currently loaded from vrml.
		    Several issues with the convergence of tha algorithm still exist!

ndt_wavefront/	  : a modification of the wavefront path planner that operates directly in
		    3D-NDT maps. 
		    note: experimental code, migrated from previous repository.

ndt_utils/	  : packages used for various small projects and utility functions.
		    (internal)

spatial_representation/: code to generate samples from point clouds for spatial 
			 representation testing. (internal)

The code in this project is written as a ROS package for ROS C Turtle. In order to build,
put the stack oru-ros-pkg in your ROS code source directory and use rosmake. For an 
introduction to ROS check http://www.ros.org

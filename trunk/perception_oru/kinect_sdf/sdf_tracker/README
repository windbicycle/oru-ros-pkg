The standalone version of CMakeLists.txt will allow compilation outside the rosbuild environment.
This is not very well tested at the moment. 

Instructions:

Rename CMakeLists_STANDALONE.txt to CMakeLists.txt and do 

mkdir build
cd build && cmake ..
make

The sdf_tracker_app is a quite minimal example of the SDF_tracker in use and requires your OpenCV library to be compiled with support for OpenNI.
For instructions on how to do this, please refer to http://docs.opencv.org/doc/user_guide/ug_highgui.html

For "normal" use within the ros framework, documentation can be found at http://ros.org/wiki/sdf_tracker

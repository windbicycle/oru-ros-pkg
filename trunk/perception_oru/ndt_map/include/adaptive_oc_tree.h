/** \brief Implements an OctTree with adaptive leaf splitting as a post process step
    \details The OctTree is split unitl a conservative initial size. After this, a post
processing step is used to determine if the gaussians in each leaf are well-fitting.
At the moment one heuristic option is available - using the residual squares sum and
the residual variance. A second option using the omnibus normality test will be added
soon.
